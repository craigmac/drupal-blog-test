# Drupal 10 blog example

Following [official docs local development guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/official_docs/local-development-guide).

How do you see this in action when you clone it? Wish I knew, sorry. The Drupal
docs are/have been overhauled in the last ~3 months to focus on Docker-based
deployments, and some of the old docs for doing things the LAMP/MAMP way were
causing me too much trouble on both macOS and Linux Mint. I ran out of time
trying different distributions and install methods, and just stuck with the
official 'happy path'.
